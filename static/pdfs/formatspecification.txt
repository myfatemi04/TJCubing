Make a folder with some title.
In that folder, put the PDFs and other associated files.
Make a file called "desc.txt" which should include these key, value pairs:
title, author, date, pdf, slides, url

Each key, value should be specified like "key: value" and be on its own line.
There should be no other lines.

Example: /static/pdfs/Computational Cube Theory/desc.txt
title: Computational Cube Theory
author: Stephen Huan
date: 04/20/2019
pdf: cubetheory.pdf
slides: Computational Cube Theory.pdf
url: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iRihHkXuySt3UQjYGrG1rVhdg87WOb4nCmTgMW9cxbg

Note that the "title" value and folder name should be the same.
